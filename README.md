## Description
This library provides a simple to use webgl shader component, with included framework wrappers and strong typing. Shaders are powerful tools and can be used to add a lot of visual interest to your web project. However, setting-up many shader tools can be complicated and add a large bundle to your project, this library provides a simple core package to make rendering a shader in your DOM incredibly easy.

## Core Concepts
### Why
While libraries like [three.js](https://threejs.org/) are amazing, not every project requires the level of depth provided. This is a zero-dependency library that provides a simple to use component for rendering GLSL shaders on the web.

## Installation & Usage
```zsh
npm i simple-shader-component
```
